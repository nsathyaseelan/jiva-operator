| Type  | Description                                                  | Storage | K8s Platform |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| Chaos | Evict the pod by tainting node and check if it gets rescheduled again | OpenEBS | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Application writes are successful 

## Exit-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils
- Storage target pods are healthy

## Notes

- Typically used as a disruptive test, to evict the pod by tainting the corresponding node.
- The application pod should be rescheduled successfully.
