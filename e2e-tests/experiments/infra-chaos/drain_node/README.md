| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Chaos | Drain the node where application pod is scheduled. | OpenEBS | Percona MySQL | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Application writes are successful 

## Exit-Criteria

- Application pod should be scheduled again.
- Data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read
- Storage target pods are healthy

## Notes

- This experiment drains the node where application pod is running and ensures if it is scheduled on another available node.

## Associated Utils 

- `cordon_drain_node.yaml`
