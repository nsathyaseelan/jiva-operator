## Experiment Metadata

| Type  | Description                                                  | Storage | K8s Platform |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| Chaos | Inject delay in storage replica and verify the application availability | OpenEBS | Any          |

## Entry-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Application writes are successful 

## Exit-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read
- Database consistency is maintained as per db integrity check utils
- Storage target pods are healthy

## Notes

- Typically used as a disruptive test, to cause loss of access to storage replica by injecting network delay using pumba.
- The application pod should be healthy once it gets recovered.

## Associated Utils 

- `jiva_replica_network_delay.yaml`,`cstor_replica_network_delay.yaml`
